## Overview

This study quantified the global dynamics of breast cancer ASR (world) of mortality versus incidence across continents and HDI levels. In 2022, Africa exhibited the highest positive slope values for both age brackets ([0-39] and [40-85+]), while Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania showed intermediate values. Europe had a slope value closest to zero, and Northern America displayed a negative slope. These findings aligned well with the broader trend where lower HDI levels correlated with higher slope values. Projections for 2050 indicated significant increases in the burden of breast cancer, with persistent yet varied disparities and differences among age groups, continents, and HDI levels.
Notably, in 2022, Africa had a uniquely higher slope value of mortality versus incidence rate for the age group [0-39] compared to [40-85+]. By 2050, the number of deaths in the [0-39] age group in Africa was projected to exceed that of Asia, making it the highest among all continents. 
Conversely, areas with very high and high HDI levels are expected to experience decreases in both new cases and deaths for the same age group from 2022 to 2050.

## Breast cancer risk factors
Breast cancer risk factors encompass various aspects such as early age at menopause, advanced age at first birth, having fewer children, limited breastfeeding, use of menopausal hormone replacement therapy and oral contraceptives, higher body mass index, lack of physical activity, increased life expectancy, favorable socio-cultural environments, dietary risks including alcohol consumption and smoking, metabolic factors, excess exposure to ionizing radiation, and certain genetic predispositions.

# Suggestions
As of strategies, the answer lies within. For breast cancer, our overall goal remains unchanged: to reduce incidence, enhance effective early-stage diagnosis, and improve treatment outcomes. We advocate for individuals to adopt a healthier lifestyle, including regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and following a proper diet. Additionally, it's crucial to increase awareness of breast cancer risk factors, ensure access to diagnostic resources, and work towards reducing stigma, such as fatalistic attitudes.
Under the umbrella, different age groups (under 40 and 40 years and older), alongside populations in high-HDI developed countries and low- to middle-HDI developing countries, necessitate distinct approaches. For those in high-HDI settings with ample access to breast cancer screening and subsequent management, the focus can work towards refining screening accuracy, addressing psychological impacts, and minimizing risks associated with ionizing radiation and its effects on secondary tumors. Conversely, for low or middle-HDI regions with limited access to mammography screening and effective breast cancer treatments, strategies may involve: 1) Promoting cost-effective screening methods such as clinical breast examinations, 2) Negotiating for reduced treatment costs and establishing partnerships for subsidized treatments, 3) Fostering broaden treatment options and empower local healthcare providers, 4) Investing in healthcare infrastructure upgrades and telemedicine solutions, and 5) Encouraging collaborative efforts among governments and private sectors to pool resources and expertise.
